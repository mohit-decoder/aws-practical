why we need cloud mointoring?
1. to enhance performance [monitoring logs and by seeing the graphs]
2. cost management: [we can set alaram when the servers are high and vice versa we can reduce or add resources into it to manage our budget and optimize the resources.]
3. detecting errors and troubleshooting: [if a server is failed in operation by using cloud watch service we get notified for failure operation.]

why do we need cloud based mointoring? 

1. to mointor system performance
2. to reduce unnecessary operating cost.
3. detect the errors to prevent and overcome from downtime and busniess losses.

what is amazon cloudwatch?
amazon cloudwatch is the component of aws that provides real time monitoring of aws resources and customer application running on amazon infrastructure both basic and detailed mointoring.

there are two types of monitoring offered by aws cloudwatch:
1. basic monitoring [free of cost. polls every 5 min. very few metrics]
2. detailed monitoring [its charged. polls every 1 min. wide range metrics]

cloudwatch [PRACTICAL]

CREATE AN INSTANCE: 
	take ssh of instance
	# yum install httpd
	# systemctl start httpd
	# systemctl enable httpd
	# vim /var/www/html/index.html
	# <h1>
		hello world
	  </h1>
	# systemctl restart httpd
hit the ip of instance over the internet
	# cd /var/log/httpd
	# cat access_log
attach the role in the instance: create a role > aws-services > ec2 > CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy > mm-cloudwatch-role
	
now download the awslog package cd /
	# yum install awslogs -y
	# systemctl start awslogsd.service
	# systemctl restart awslogsd.service
	# cd /etc/awslogs
	# vim awscli.conf
	change the region = us-west-2[as per your instance region]
	# vim awslogs.conf
	# [/var/log/httpd/access_log]
	  datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S
	  file = /var/log/httpd/access_log
	  buffer_duration = 5000
	  log_stream_name = httpd{instance_id}
	  initial_position = start_of_file
	  log_group_name = /var/log/httpd/access_log
	  
	  [/var/log/httpd/error_log]
	  datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S
	  file = /var/log/httpd/error_log
	  buffer_duration = 5000
	  log_stream_name = httpd{instance_id}
 	  initial_position = start_of_file
	  log_group_name = /var/log/httpd/error_log

now go to cloudwatch in console and go to log group.
you will see the logs.
