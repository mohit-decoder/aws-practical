Hardlink and Softlink:

Hardlink: A hardlink is acts as a copy of the selected files. 
		files that are hard linked take the same inode number.
		hardlinks are not allowed for directories. [only superuser can do it.]

Softlink : A softlink also known as symbolic link act as a pointer or a reference to file name.
		files that are softlink take a different link count.
		softlink can be used for linking directories.

special permission:

- setuid permission [suid] : this special permission allows all users to access files and directories that are nnormally available to root.
					chmod u+s /sbin/dmidecode
					chmod u-s /sbin/dmidecode 
-setgid permission [sgid] : files that were created in this directory is belong to particular user in that group.
					chmod g+s 
					
-sticky-bit : sitcky bit is used for avoid deletion of files or directory by other user.
		  chmod o+t /directoryname

access control list : acl use to set permission over files and directory to specific user or specific group we can assign the multiple user with different permission on the same file or different.

	setfacl -m u:username:rwx /filename
	getfacl /filename [to see the permission.]

Archiving and Compression :

Archiving is the process of combining  multiple files and directories into one file.

Compression is the process of reducing the size of the file or directory.

Archiving is usually used as a part of a system backup and moving one data from one system to another.

tar -cvf etc.tar /etc  [ to create a tar file ]
tar -tvf etc.tar 		[  to list the tar file ]
tar -xvf etc.tar -C /demo [ to extract the tar file ]

gzip command : tar -cvf /etc.tar /etc
			 gzip etc.tar.gz 
			unzip etc.tar.gz
Scheduling Task : Job scheduling is a feature that allows a user to submit a command or program for execution at a sepcifed time in the future.

at - single time execution.
